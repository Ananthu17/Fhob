Show me what you've got. </p><p>They square off and start the sparring. Max is more elusive. As Andrei moves forward, Max moves to the side delivering two light punches to Andrei's head and finishes the combination with a kick to the body. Andrei stops.</p><p>ANDREI (CONT'D)</p><p>Shit. You're pretty good. </p><p>MAX</p><p>Thanks. </p><p>ANDREI</p><p>Dude, you should train or compete. </p><p>MAX</p><p>No one is hiring. </p><p>ANDREI</p><p>It's tough. You know, talk to Monya.

May I have another kiss?</p><p>ANGELA</p><p>Not until you tell me...</p><p>Max rolls on top of her and looks into her eyes.</p><p>MAX</p><p>Then I'll kiss you, because I love this woman more than anything in the whole wide World. </p><p>ANGELA</p><p>You promise? </p><p>MAX</p><p>On my life. </p><p>She smiles.</p><p>ANGELA</p><p>OK, you can kiss me. </p><p>They kiss. </p><p>ANGELA (CONT'D)</p><p>Should we go to see the apartment?  </p><p>Max</p><p>Ohh.</p><p>He glances at his watch. </p><p>Max (CONT'D)</p><p>We have ten minutes to get there.</p><p>He gets up and pulls Angela on her feet. They laugh and run from the shore toward the buildings. </p><p>Ext. Two-story duplex - dAY</p><p>A traditional two-story house stands among similar houses. </p><p>Angela and Max walk to the duplex. They hear Latin music coming from the basement. Angela checks out the house and looks at Max.</p><p>ANGELA</p><p>Are you sure this is the house? </p><p>Max</p><p>Yup.</p><p>ANGELA</p><p>It's nice, but how... </p><p>MAX</p><p>Babe, I told you, Alan will wait until I get a job. Don't you worry.</p><p>He smiles as he touches her nose with his finger. </p><p>Max (CONT'D)</p><p> And there he comes. </p><p>He nods at a short man quickly walking towards them. ALAN (35) waves. </p><p>Alan</p><p>Hey guys, sorry I'm late. </p><p>He shakes Max's hand and offers his hand to Angela. She takes it.</p><p>Alan (CONT'D)</p><p>Alan. And you're Angela, I assume. </p><p>ANGELA</p><p>Yes. Nice to meet you. </p><p>ALAN</p><p>OK, let's see it.</p><p>He quickly walks to the stairs leading into the basement. Angela stares at the basement door and gives Max a look. </p><p>Int. Basement - dAY</p><p>Unpainted vases cover the floor of the basement. Dust suspends in the air all the way to a very low ceiling.</p><p>Alan, Max and Angela walk in and get exposed to the Latino music blasting out of an old boombox. ABERTO, a young Latino man, is loudly singing along with it.  </p><p>AlaN</p><p>This is Aberto, my worker. </p><p>Aberto looks at them as he polishes a vase. Max nods at him. Aberto nods back and takes a high note. </p><p>ALan (CONT'D)</p><p>He wants to be a singer. </p><p>He leads Angela and Max through the room to a small door at the end, unlocks it and walks in. </p><p>Int. Basement-apartment - dAY</p><p>Angela has to bend down as she follows Alan into the apartment. Alan clicks the switch. </p><p>A single bulb, hanging on a wire, lights up a bare concrete box of a room. </p><p>In shock, Angela moves her eyes from a dirty ground level window to a dirty small kitchen and then to an open tiny shower space near a toilet. She turns to Max and sees that his head almost touches the bare pipes hanging by the ceiling. She looks down at the concrete floor and sees a centipede running by her foot. She screams and jumps toward Max. He hugs her as he looks around.   </p><p>ANGELA</p><p>I can't live in here. </p><p>She cries. </p><p>ANGELA (CONT'D)</p><p>Centipedes. I can't. </p><p>MAX</p><p>Baby, we'll be OK. </p><p>She looks around.</p><p>ANGELA</p><p>How're we gonna sleep? There's no furniture. </p><p>Alan looks around with a positive attitude. </p><p>AlaN</p><p>Hey, it's not too bad. I'll give you couch cushions from the office for a few days to sleep on. </p><p>Angela calms down a bit.</p><p>AlaN (CONT'D)</p><p>And on Tuesday we'll go to get your new furniture. </p><p>MAX</p><p>Why on Tuesday? </p><p>ALAN</p><p>It's trash day. I'll be back with the cushions. </p><p>On his way out, he throws the key on the counter. </p><p>Max and Angela hold each other tight as they listen to Aberto and the Latino music blasting from behind the wall. Loud steps and screams from the apartment above add to the cacophony of noises.  </p><p>Back to:</p><p>Int. carson beach - mORNING</p><p>The young couple walks away. </p><p>Max takes a sip of his coffee and glances around. Another couple with a toddler and a dog walk on the beach. </p><p>The kid and the dog run to the water. The father runs after them laughing. He catches the child, grabs him and spins him around. The happy laughter reaches Max. He smiles as he watches them playing. After a while he gets his cell phone, scrolls to a number that says &quot;Emma&quot; and pushes the talk button. A few beeps. Emma picks up the phone. </p><p>EMMA (V.O.)</p><p>Hello.</p><p>Max</p><p>Emma?</p><p>Emma (V.O.)</p><p>Max?</p><p>MAX</p><p>Are you busy? </p><p>EMMA (V.O.)</p><p>No, not really.

I would be scared to death.</p><p>Morgan</p><p>No, you wouldn't, you are big. </p><p>Max and Emma smile as they watch Morgan finishing the last slice of pizza. Max glances at Emma and freezes. Rays of sun highlight her hair. She looks beautiful. Their eyes meet. The pause gets a bit too long as they look at each other.   </p><p>MAX</p><p>Ahh, are you guys ready for ice cream?</p><p>MORGAN</p><p>Yay!</p><p>Max keeps his eyes on Emma.</p><p>MAX</p><p>I know a great place by the beach. </p><p>Emma smiles. </p><p>EMMA</p><p>OK. </p><p>Max smiles back.</p><p>MAX</p><p>OK.</p><p>He looks at Morgan.</p><p>Max (CONT'D)</p><p>Are you ready?</p><p>Morgan</p><p>Yes!

The girl is laughing her head off as she glances back at Max. He catches her and spins her around. Emma smiles as she watches them playing. </p><p>Emma and Max slowly stroll down the beach. Morgan sits on Max's neck. They are having a good time. </p><p>Int. CHEVY CONVERTIBLE - eVENING</p><p>Dark. Max drives down a street. He glances at Emma. She smiles.

He kisses her more and more passionately as he leads her out of Morgan's room. </p><p>Int. Emma's bedroom - mORNING</p><p>Max is in the bed, sleeping. Rays of sun break through the curtains and fall on his face. He opens his eyes and looks around. Emma is not there. </p><p>Max gets up and puts his clothes on. He takes a step toward the door and sees a visualization board hanging on the wall. There are pictures of a fancy house, a Range Rover, a beautiful tropical beach, an engagement diamond ring and other things. Max smirks as he looks at the pictures and walks out of the room.    </p><p>Int.
