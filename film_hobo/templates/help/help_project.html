                            To do that, create a new Project and attach the team which worked on your film originally, and then post the video of that film on the Screening Room page. You will need to invite all the team members if they want to get credit for their work. If their accounts are not active, they will not be able to get the credit and the rating they deserve.

                            rate it. You will rely on your peers in your network to support you.
