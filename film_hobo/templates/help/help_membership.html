                                membership to Pro by building up your rating. You will need five (5) projects or
                                roles you participated in and collect at least a 4-star rating for each role. Also,
                                each project or role needs to have at least ten (10) members who would rate your
                                work. After you achieve that your Indie membership will change to Pro automatically.

                        that, your trial period expires, your credit card will be charged, and no refund will be
