                        Definitely! Companies and Project Creators may use SAMR to limit who can contact them,

                        (a) A Production Company or an Agency may set a SAMR submission requirement as “Pro with 4
                        stars or above”. That means that only Members with that SAMR or above can submit their
                        inquiry to the Company.

                    <div class="mt-1">
                        (b) a Project Creator may set a SAMR for Talent and Crew to apply for a job. That means that
                        members with a SAMR below that requirement will not be able to apply for the job.
