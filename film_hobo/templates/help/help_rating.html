                        Rating is your currency. It shows your skill level to the whole FilmHobo professional
                        community. The higher your rating is, the more desirable you are.
                    </div>
                    <div class="mt-2">The rating will be judged by a five stars system, where five stars is the best
                        and one star is the worst. The total rating will be calculated as an average of all ratings
                        combined from each role you have participated in. </div>
                    <div class="mt-2">Only premium members can rate your work. </div>
                    <div class="mt-2">To build your rating fast use Scene projects. Usually, it takes years to build
                        your professional resume, but with FilmHobo Scenes production you can do it in no time.
                        Always, choose a scene that is the best to showcase your talent and your abilities. </div>

                        How do I get Credit?
                    </div>
                    <div class="mt-2">To get credit as an actor or director you must participate in any project on
                        the FilmHobo platform as an actor or director. </div>
                    <div class="mt-2">The moment you get attached to a project (for any position) you will get the
                        related credit.
                        For example – if you’ve been attached to a project as an actor and editor, you will get two
                        credits “Actor” and “Editor”. Those credits will be posted on your personal page, as well as
                        the related rating.
                    </div>
                    <div class="mt-2">You can state your previous jobs or your skills in your bio, but you will only
                        get credit after you’ve been attached to a project on the FilmHobo site. </div>

                        members have been working on. As a crew member you should ask your co-workers and filmmakers

                        For any reason, if you don’t want to display your rating you can turn it off using settings.
                        Your rating will be “visible” to the FilmHobo system though. So, when you apply for a job or
                        contact a Company, and your SAMR is not meeting their requirements you will not be able to
                        apply or contact them.
